The effect of increasing the residual blocks makes the loss of the test set smaller in the deblurring model
but not always in the loss in the denoising model. We can see in the deblur plot that as we increase the number of
residual blocks the mse is smaller and also image wise when we look at a deblurred image as has been restored we can
see a vast difference between a deblurring model that had lower residual blocks and one that had higher residual blocks.
On the other hand we can see that there is some kind of overfitting in the denoising model as we get higher residual
blocks the mse in the graph gets higher. In images we can see the image that was restored from the model with 5 residual
blocks looked worse than a restored image that had 4 residual blocks.
