This implementation will work for the follow reasons. Firstly, the corruption function works because we want to
"ruin" the resolution of the image. We do that by zooming out, when we zoom out we "erase" some of the pixels.
After that we zoom in but we have to guess some of the pixels making the zoomed in image corrupted.
It will work because the learning model is written like the deblurring learning model.
