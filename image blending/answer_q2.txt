Blending with small image filter we get poor blend(no smooth transition between the two images)
and the image looks like two images stuck together. Blending with big image filters causes the imaage to look
distorted and smeared meaning the edges between both images looks smeared  and not exact.
The reasoning behind this is as follows for having a small image filter.
Because when we build the laplacian pyramid we resize the picture and when we
don't blur it properly we lose information so after building the laplacian pyramid and
blending two images together we get no smooth transition because of the lose of information.
Now for the reason behind the smeared edges in big image filters. When we have a big image filter
we blur a pixel with a lot of other pixels that are not close to the pixel itself, that's why when
blending two images together and have a large filter we lose the masking process of it because we blur the image with
pixels that dont belong to the image.
