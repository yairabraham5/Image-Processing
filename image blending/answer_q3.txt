The thing that happens when we blend two images when their pyramid levels are low is as follows. The blended image
looks like two images that have been "taped" together. The reason behind it is because when the pyramid levels are
really low we get two pictures that have a really high outlines so when we try and blend the two pictures together
we  get some sort of "crash" between the two pictures causing it to looked "taped".
The thing that happens when we blend two images when their pyramid levels are high is as follows.
The blended image looks smeared in the edges between the two original images.
The reason behind this is because when we make the pyramid longer we get pictures that are so blurred that we lose the
theme of the image. So after we build the blended image we use levels of the pyramid that are blurred causing
the final image to be blurred.
