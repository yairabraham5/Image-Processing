Both functions do the same thing change the samples. But the first
spectrogram_resize is given a data and resize it to a new data but without phase shifting the
frequencies causing the audio file to be muffled and unclear.
On the other hand vocoder_resize does phase shift the frequencies after resizing the new data
that's why the audio file isn't muffled and clearer.
