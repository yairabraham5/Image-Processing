The reason we multiply each level with a coefficient because we want to control
the way our picture works if we multiply the lower levels of the pyramids with
coefficients that are bigger than one then the outlines will be much clearer
and if we multiply it with a coefficients that are smaller we get blurrier picture
but at the higher levels of the pyramid we give them a coefficient bigger than one
we make the picture blurrier.
